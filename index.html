                <h2>A short guide to universities in the United States <br> for Singapore junior college students</h2>

                <p><b><i>Preface</i></b></p>

                <p>When I started out as a junior at Anglo-Chinese Junior College, I knew as long as a performed well academically, I would be guaranteed a generous scholarship to attend any of the local universities. There were nothing to complain; Singapore has a stellar tertiary education system, and I felt so honored and privileged that they would welcome me with open arms. </p>

                <p>Still, I desired to go out and see more of the world, just like how I had come to Singapore some years earlier and had learned so much about life. I was told by my seniors that opportunities to go overseas abounded, as long as I was willing to search for them. And find them, I did.</p>

                <p>This guide distills what I have learned during my search for scholarships overseas. As I head to the University of Alabama this fall with a full tuition waiver, I hope that after reading this guide, you too will find that even without Singapore government or industry scholarships, there are still so many doors open overseas for you.</p>

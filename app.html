                <h3>What are the college application schemes and their respective deadlines in the United States?</h3>
                <p>While each college and university has its own deadlines for application submission, deadlines mostly depend on the application scheme you are applying under. Many institutions allow applications through the <a href="#commonapp">CommonApp</a> portal.</p>
                <p>Under the Early Decision scheme, students can apply to one, and only one, school. If admitted, the student is legally obligated to attend that college or university, and must withdraw all applications to other schools. There are two rounds of Early Decision. In the first round, applications are usually due in October, and outcomes are usually releashed in December. In the second round, applicants can switch the Regular Decision application at one school to Early Decision in January. Most schools offer round one of Early Decision.</p>
                <p>Under the Early Action scheme, students can apply to multiple schools. If admitted, the student has until May 1st to reply to each school whether to attend. Applications are usually due in November, and outcomes are usually released in January. Not many schools offer this scheme.</p>
                <p>Under the Regular Decision, students can apply to multiple schools. If admitted, the student has until May 1st to reply to each school whether to attend. Applications are usually due on January 1st, and outcomes are released by April 1st. Most schools offer this scheme.</p>
                <p>Under the Rolling Admission scheme, applications are continuously processed and outcomes are released according to the date of application submission. This scheme is usually offered at schools where admission is less competitive, usually public universities.</p>
                <p>Merit scholarships applications, at both private and public institutions, are usually due in December.</p>

                <h3>How is the college admission process in the United States different from Singapore, the United Kingdom and Australia?</h3>
                <p>In Singapore, the United Kingdom and Australia, the university admission process is largely merit-based. In other words, the most important factor when assessing a candidate is his or her academic caliber. Co-curricular activities and personal qualities are considered, but are not overriding factors.</p>
                <p>Many, mostly private, institutions in the United States employs the <a href="#holistic-admission">holistic admission</a> process. A candidate is assessed based on his or her academic caliber, out-of-class achievements and special talents, personal qualities and beliefs, and socioeconomic background.</p>

            <div class="question" id="application-material">
                <h3>What material is required in the college application in the United States?</h3>
                <p>While required application materials differ across institutions, usually the following are required:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A scan of grade 9 to 12 transcripts, meaning O Level, J1 Promotional, J2 Preliminary and Predicted A Level results, plus an explanatory note explaining what these results mean in Singapore</li>
                    <li>A counselor's report, commenting on your academic and extra-curricular achievements</li>
                    <li>Two recommendation letters from teachers of academic subjects, commenting on your academic caliber and personal qualities</li>
                    <li><a href="sat-act">SAT or ACT</a> score, with essay score</li>
                    <li>A <a href="personal-essay">personal essay</a></li>
                    <li>A complementary essay explaining why the institution appeals to you and how you can contribute to the institution</li>
                    <li>TOEFL/IELTS scores, though this requirement is usually waived for Singaporean students</li>
                    <li>Financial support documents</li>
                </ul>
                <p>More competitive institutions often ask for the following additional materials:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Two SAT II scores</li>
                    <li>A complementary essay demonstrating your thought process, world view, ideals and beliefs</li>
                    <li>An interview</li>

            <div class="question" id="holistic-admission">
                <h3>How does the holistic admission process work?</h3>
                <p>It is easier to understand the holistic admission process if we understand its purpose: building a diverse, well-rounded freshmen cohort.</p>
                <p>In Singapore, diversity is a largely an outcome of a large student intake. E.g., Nanyang Teachnological University admits roughly 4,000 new freshmen annually, and the National University of Singapore, 6000. Such large groups of students are bound to be diverse. As such, the university admission process need not be designed with diversity at the center. In fact, Singaporean meritocracy demands that local universities give priorities to the most academically able.</p>
                <p>In contrast, in the United States, many elite universities have annual intakes hovering around 1000–2000 students, and elite colleges, 300–600. </p>

            <div class="question" id="personal-essay">
                <h3>How should the personal essay be written?</h3>
                <p>The personal essay is the protocol for each student to demonstrate his or her uniqueness.</p>
                <p>Due to the 650-word limit, the essay is recommended to focus on one single moment, incident, or story, with ample details, illustrations and reflections. It is not recommended to cram too many events or ideas into one single essay with insufficient elaboration. Assuming most admission officer will be burdened with a ton of essays, ideally the essay should be able to give a lasting impression of you to the officer after just one read through: he or she should be able to summarize the essay into a one-sentence remark about how you are special.</p>
                <p>The scope of CommonApp essay prompts are very broad and students can effectively write about any subject they desire. However, stylistic elements aside, the narrative in the essay should zoom in on one area of substantial value, for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A personal quality, e.g. tenacity</li>
                    <li>A passion, e.g. for violin</li>
                    <li>A perception of the world, e.g. why a certain societal value exists, and your take on it</li>
                    <li>A personal belief, e.g. how a certain technology hampers social ties, and how this belief shapes your actions</li>
                    <li>An identity, i.e. how you define your position in your immediate environment</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Whatever the focus, the essay should be personal, i.e. it should be heavily tinged with personal circumstances and reflections, and ideas discussed should be contextualized into your immediate setting. E.g., if you discuss tenacity, you should illustrate how you define it via specific actions, how it manifests in your personal situations, and how your version of being tenacious is different from someone else's, etc.</p>
                <p>Most well-written essays make use of the "show, not tell" approach, where ample details and illustrations are used to vividly paint out a point, instead of bluntly spelling it outright.</p>
                <p>Some reference essays are published by <a href="http://apply.jhu.edu/apply/essays/">John Hopkins University</a>, <a href="http://www.conncoll.edu/admission/apply/essays-that-worked/">Connecticut College</a>, <a href="http://admissions.tufts.edu/apply/essay-questions/past-essays/">Tufts University</a> and many more.</p>

                <h3>Does the amount of need-based financial aid requested affect the chance of getting admitted for international students?</h3>
                <p>Yes, at most institutions.</p>
                <p>Only a few elite institutions claim to be need-blind&mdash;meaning they do not take financial circumstances into consideration during the admission process, and promise to grant sufficient financial assistance so that whomever they choose to admit can attend, regardless of household income.</p>
                <p>Most institutions that grant need-based financial assistance are need-aware.</p>

            <div class="question" id="sat-act">
                <h3>What is a good SAT/ACT score?</h3>
                <p>SAT and ACT scores are only of minor importance when "selective" institutions consider which applicants to admit. However, SAT and ACT scores do act as a good indicator of the general academic ability of the student population at a specific institution. Hence, if your standardized test scores fall on the 75th percentile of a school, you should be able to cope relatively well in academics at that school. It is recommended to choose academically-matching schools to apply using SAT and ACT scores, instead of grinding those tests to get marginally higher scores to apply to more prestigous institutions.</p>

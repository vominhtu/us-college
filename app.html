                <h3>What are the college application schemes and their respective deadlines in the United States?</h3>
                <p>While each college and university has its own deadlines for application submission, deadlines mostly depend on the application scheme you are applying under. Many institutions allow applications through the <a href="#commonapp">CommonApp</a> portal.</p>
                <p>Under the <b>Early Decision</b> scheme, students can apply to one, and only one, school. If admitted, the student is legally obligated to attend that college or university, and must withdraw all applications to other schools. There are two rounds of Early Decision. In the first round, applications are usually due in October, and outcomes are usually releashed in December. In the second round, applicants can switch the Regular Decision application at one school to Early Decision in January. Most schools offer round one of Early Decision.</p>
                <p>Under the <b>Early Action</b> scheme, students can apply to multiple schools. If admitted, the student has until May 1st to reply to each school whether to attend. Applications are usually due in November, and outcomes are usually released in January. Not many schools offer this scheme.</p>
                <p>Under the <b>Regular Decision</b>, students can apply to multiple schools. If admitted, the student has until May 1st to reply to each school whether to attend. Applications are usually due on January 1st, and outcomes are released by April 1st. Most schools offer this scheme.</p>
                <p>Under the <b>Rolling Admission</b> scheme, applications are continuously processed and outcomes are released according to the date of application submission. This scheme is usually offered at schools where admission is less competitive, usually public universities.</p>
                <p>Merit scholarships applications, at both private and public institutions, are usually due in December.</p>

            <div class="question" id="commonapp">
                <h3>What is the Common Application?</h3>
                <p>To access the CommonApp website, follow this <a href="https://www.commonapp.org">link</a>.</p>
                <p>In contrast to the straight-forward university admission process in Singapore, many institutions in the United States require applicants to submit <a href="#application-material">quite a number of documents</a> as part of the <a href="#holistic-admission">holistic admission process</a>. Handling the paperwork with individual institutions would cause students, teachers and school counselors great inconvenience.</p>
                <p>The Common Application portal was created to handle this issue. Students only need to submit portions of the application that are similar across colleges&ndash;e.g. teachers' recommendations, the counselor's report and the personal essay&ndash; once to the CommonApp portal. Some individual institutions will require complementary questions to be answered to complete the application. The CommonApp portal also help students keep check of which document has been submitted to which college.</p>
                <p>Not all universities and colleges accept applications through the Common Application portal.</p>

                <h3>How is the college admission process in the United States different from Singapore, the United Kingdom and Australia?</h3>
                <p>In Singapore, the United Kingdom and Australia, the university admission process is largely merit-based. In other words, the most important factor when assessing a candidate is his or her academic caliber. Co-curricular activities and personal qualities are considered, but are not overriding factors.</p>
                <p>Many, mostly private, institutions in the United States employs the <a href="#holistic-admission">holistic admission</a> process. A candidate is assessed based on his or her academic caliber, out-of-class achievements and special talents, personal qualities and beliefs, and socioeconomic background.</p>

            <div class="question" id="application-material">
                <h3>What material is required in the college application in the United States?</h3>
                <p>While required application materials differ across institutions, usually the following are required:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A scan of grade 9 to 12 transcripts, meaning O Level, J1 Promotional, J2 Preliminary and Predicted A Level results, plus an explanatory note explaining what these results mean in Singapore</li>
                    <li>A counselor's report, commenting on your academic and extra-curricular achievements</li>
                    <li>Two recommendation letters from teachers of academic subjects, commenting on your academic caliber and personal qualities</li>
                    <li><a href="sat-act">SAT or ACT</a> score, with essay score</li>
                    <li>A <a href="personal-essay">personal essay</a></li>
                    <li>A complementary essay explaining why the institution appeals to you and how you can contribute to the institution</li>
                    <li>TOEFL/IELTS scores, though this requirement is usually waived for Singaporean students</li>
                    <li>Financial support documents</li>
                </ul>
                <p>More competitive institutions often ask for the following additional materials:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Two SAT II scores</li>
                    <li>A complementary essay demonstrating your thought process, world view, ideals and beliefs</li>
                    <li>An interview</li>

            <div class="question" id="holistic-admission">
                <h3>How does the holistic admission process work?</h3>
                <p>It is easier to understand the holistic admission process if we understand its purpose: building a diverse, well-rounded freshmen cohort, while meeting institutional requirements.</p>
                <p>Diversity is not narrowly defined in terms of academic and extracurricular interests, but also encompasses personalities (e.g. introverted versus extraverted, rational versus emotional), thinking patterns (linear versus lateral), perception of the world, personal values and beliefs, etc. Diversity is greatly emphasized as it is a central part of the <a href="intro.html#liberal-arts">liberal arts</a> education, where students are encouraged to explore complexities of the world from each other as much as from instructors.</p>
                <p>In Singapore, diversity is a largely an outcome of a large student intake. E.g., Nanyang Teachnological University admits roughly 4,000 new freshmen annually, and the National University of Singapore, 6000. Such large groups of students are bound to be diverse. As such, the university admission process need not be designed with diversity at the center. In fact, Singaporean meritocracy demands that local universities give priorities to the most academically able.</p>
                <p>In contrast, in the United States, many elite universities have annual intakes hovering around 1000–2000 students, and liberal arts colleges, 300–600. The lower the freshmen intake, the more a score-based admission process manifests its inability to ascertain diversity. Moreover, countless American institutions do not believe test scores to be a good indicator of future success to begin with. In such context, it makes for sense for a school to hand-pick from the applicants pool a group of students with varied attributes.</p>
                <p>Generally, the admission committee will try to pick out the best group of candidates that satisfy the following conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The group should cover a good mix of geographic distributions, socioeconomic standings, and ethnicities</li>
                    <li>The <i>group</i> should possess a wide breadth of extracurricular achievements, passions, personalities, values and beliefs</li>
                    <li>Each <i>individual</i> should offer some unique value, e.g. exceptional flair for research, fresh and interesting critical analysis of societal norms, prowess in team sports, etc.</li>
                    <li>Every candidate should satisfy a certain academic standard, but beyond this threshold, differences in academic abilities are of minor importance</li>
                    <li>There should be a reasonable number of students interested in each major offered by the institution</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In other words, schools generally avoids admitting "too many of the same kind," in order to create diversity. This is the reason why many outstanding applicants, with stellar test scores and cocurricular achievements, get rejected: his or her profile did not fit well with the group that were accepted. E.g., let say that John was an exceptional swimmer, an inspiring leader of the guitar club, and a devout community servant, while still consistently ranking among the top academic performers. Yet, John could well be rejected because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Someone with a similar profile was admitted the previous year</li>
                    <li>Someone with a similar profile, but a different personality, was preferred</li>
                    <li>Among others who were admitted, there were already swimmers and guitar players, even though they they were not as good as John</li>
                    <li>Someone with weaker academics and achievements than John, but possessing a more interesting passion and world view, was preferred</li>
                    <li>John's application package portrayed him as too generic a student, albeit an excellent one, without any clear personal philosophy or ambition</li>
                    <li>John was interested in History, but the History department was being overloaded, while the Chemistry was being seriously undersubcribed, so someone interested in Chemistry was admitted instead</li>
                    <li>John was interested in Computer Science, but the institution was pushing for more female computer scientists</li>
                    <li>John's family could not afford the full school fee, but the institution ran out of scholarship funds that particular year</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Because universities and colleges are trying to maximize diversity as well as satisfy internal, institutional needs, someone who is admitted this year might not neccessarily get admitted the next or previous year. The haphazard nature of the holistic admission process makes it difficult to predict the application outcome of any particular student without some knowledge of other applicants to the same institution in the same and well as previous admission cycles.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, successful applicants are those who are well conscious of their strengths and weaknesses, personalities, opinions and dreams, and able to portray their image and identity clearly to the admission committee through essays and interviews. This process is often likened to a journey of self-discovery.</p>

            <div class="question" id="personal-essay">
                <h3>How should the personal essay be written?</h3>
                <p>The personal essay is the protocol for each student to demonstrate his or her uniqueness.</p>
                <p>Due to the 650-word limit, the essay is recommended to focus on one single moment, incident, or story, with ample details, illustrations and reflections. It is not recommended to cram too many events or ideas into one single essay with insufficient elaboration. Assuming most admission officer will be burdened with a ton of essays, ideally the essay should be able to give a lasting impression of you to the officer after just one read through: he or she should be able to summarize the essay into a one-sentence remark about how you are special.</p>
                <p>The scope of CommonApp essay prompts are very broad and students can effectively write about any subject they desire. However, stylistic elements aside, the narrative in the essay should zoom in on one area of substantial value, for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A personal quality, e.g. tenacity</li>
                    <li>A passion, e.g. for violin</li>
                    <li>A perception of the world, e.g. why a certain societal value exists, and your take on it</li>
                    <li>A personal belief, e.g. how a certain technology hampers social ties, and how this belief shapes your actions</li>
                    <li>An identity, i.e. how you define your position in your immediate environment</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Whatever the focus, the essay should be personal, i.e. it should be heavily tinged with personal circumstances and reflections, and ideas discussed should be contextualized into your immediate setting. E.g., if you discuss tenacity, you should illustrate how you define it via specific actions, how it manifests in your personal situations, and how your version of being tenacious is different from someone else's, etc.</p>
                <p>Most well-written essays make use of the "show, not tell" approach, where ample details and illustrations are used to vividly paint out a point, instead of bluntly spelling it outright.</p>
                <p>Some reference essays are published by <a href="http://apply.jhu.edu/apply/essays/">John Hopkins University</a>, <a href="http://www.conncoll.edu/admission/apply/essays-that-worked/">Connecticut College</a>, <a href="http://admissions.tufts.edu/apply/essay-questions/past-essays/">Tufts University</a> and many more.</p>

            <div class="question" id="finaid-matters">
                <h3>Does the amount of need-based financial aid requested affect the chance of getting admitted for international students?</h3>
                <p>Yes, at most institutions.</p>
                <p>Only a few elite institutions claim to be need-blind&mdash;meaning they do not take financial circumstances into consideration during the admission process, and promise to grant sufficient financial assistance so that whomever they choose to admit can attend.</p>
                <p>Most institutions that grant need-based financial assistance are need-aware. This means that the number of aid-requesting applicants they can admit is limited. Some schools will choose to admit only a handful of internationals but grant them very generous aid packages, while some other schools will choose to admit a larger number of students, but grant them lower financial aid amounts. However, at most institutions, international students that can afford the full fees will have higher priorities.</p>
                <p>International students should ask their prospective universities and colleges what percentage of foreign undergraduates receive need-based financial aid, as well as the average aid amount.</p>

            <div class="question" id="sat-act">
                <h3>What is a good SAT/ACT score?</h3>
                <p>SAT and ACT scores are only of minor importance when "selective" institutions consider which applicants to admit.</p>
                <p>However, SAT and ACT scores do act as a good indicator of the general academic ability of the student population at a specific institution. Hence, if your standardized test scores fall on the 75th percentile of a school, you should be able to cope relatively well in academics at that school.</p>
                <p>It is recommended to choose academically-matching schools to apply using SAT and ACT scores, instead of grinding those tests to get marginally higher scores to apply to more prestigous institutions.</p>

            <div class="question" id="transcript-evaluation">
                <h3>What is evaluation of foreign transcript?</h3>
                <p>Sometimes an instution might require students to submit a conversion of foreign high school score reports and certificates to the United States equivalency by a third party. Most schools that Singapore students apply to do not have this requirement, but the requirement itself is legitimate and not a scam.</p>
